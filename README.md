# Masked implementation of Xoodyak
This is a side-channel protected hardware implementation of [Xoodyak](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/lightweight-cryptography/documents/finalist-round/updated-spec-doc/xoodyak-spec-final.pdf), developed by Richard Haeussler and Abubakr Abdulgadir.

The implementation uses Domain-oriented Masking (DOM).
The design is coded in VHDL hardware description language, and utilizes the latest version of GMU's [LWC Hardware API Development Package](https://github.com/GMUCERG/LWC).

Please see the accompanying [documentation](./docs/documentation.pdf) for further information.
